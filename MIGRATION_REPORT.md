# Database Migration Report: Add updated_at to project_roadmaps

## Status: MANUAL EXECUTION REQUIRED

### Issue Description
The `project_roadmaps` table is missing the `updated_at` column, causing this error:
```
record 'new' has no field 'updated_at'
```

This occurs because a database trigger (`update_project_roadmaps_updated_at`) expects this column to exist, but it doesn't.

---

## Migration Method Determined: Manual SQL Execution

### Why Manual Execution?

After attempting multiple automated approaches:
1. **PostgreSQL pg library** - Connection authentication failed (Tenant or user not found)
2. **Supabase JS client** - Cannot execute DDL statements (ALTER TABLE, CREATE TRIGGER)
3. **REST API** - No endpoint for arbitrary SQL execution
4. **Supabase CLI** - Not installed, would require additional setup

**Result**: Manual execution via Supabase SQL Editor is the FASTEST and most reliable method.

---

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Open SQL Editor
Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vfovtgtjailvrphsgafv/sql

### Step 2: Create New Query
Click the "New Query" button in the SQL Editor

### Step 3: Paste Migration SQL

```sql
-- Add updated_at column to project_roadmaps table
-- This fixes the error: record "new" has no field "updated_at"
-- which occurs because the update_project_roadmaps_updated_at trigger expects this column

-- Check if column exists before adding (idempotent)
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND table_name = 'project_roadmaps'
    AND column_name = 'updated_at'
  ) THEN
    -- Add updated_at column with default value
    ALTER TABLE public.project_roadmaps
    ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW();

    -- Update existing rows to have created_at as initial updated_at
    UPDATE public.project_roadmaps
    SET updated_at = created_at
    WHERE updated_at IS NULL;

    -- Make column NOT NULL after setting initial values
    ALTER TABLE public.project_roadmaps
    ALTER COLUMN updated_at SET NOT NULL;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Added updated_at column to project_roadmaps table';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'updated_at column already exists in project_roadmaps table';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Ensure the trigger exists (it should already exist from fix_function_search_paths.sql)
-- This is defensive programming to make sure the trigger is present
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_project_roadmaps_updated_at ON public.project_roadmaps;
CREATE TRIGGER update_project_roadmaps_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON public.project_roadmaps
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.update_updated_at_column();

-- Add comment explaining the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.project_roadmaps.updated_at IS 'Automatically updated timestamp when row is modified';
```

### Step 4: Execute
Click "Run" or press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux)

### Step 5: Verify Success
You should see a success message or notice like:
```
Added updated_at column to project_roadmaps table
```

---

## VERIFICATION

After executing the migration, run this verification script:

```bash
node scripts/verify-migration.mjs
```

Expected output:
```
✅ MIGRATION VERIFIED SUCCESSFULLY!
✓ updated_at column exists
✓ Trigger is functional
✓ Ready for production use
```

---

## What This Migration Does

1. **Checks if column exists** (idempotent - safe to run multiple times)
2. **Adds `updated_at` column** with TIMESTAMPTZ type and NOW() default
3. **Backfills existing data** by setting updated_at = created_at for all rows
4. **Sets NOT NULL constraint** after initial data is populated
5. **Creates/recreates trigger** to automatically update timestamp on row updates
6. **Adds column comment** for documentation

---

## Helper Scripts Created

### 1. Open SQL Editor and Copy SQL
```bash
node scripts/final-migration-attempt.mjs
```
- Opens SQL Editor in browser
- Copies SQL to clipboard
- Provides step-by-step instructions

### 2. Verify Migration
```bash
node scripts/verify-migration.mjs
```
- Checks if column exists
- Tests trigger functionality
- Confirms migration success

### 3. Alternative Attempts (for reference)
- `scripts/apply-migration-pg.mjs` - PostgreSQL direct connection (failed: auth)
- `scripts/migrate-with-pg.mjs` - Transaction pooler (failed: auth)
- `scripts/migrate-session-pooler.mjs` - Session pooler (failed: auth)
- `scripts/apply-migration-direct.mjs` - Supabase JS client check

---

## Testing Roadmap Functionality

After migration is verified, test the following:

### 1. Drag and Drop
- Open application roadmap view
- Drag a roadmap item to a new position
- Verify no errors in console
- Confirm item position persists after page reload

### 2. Roadmap Updates
- Edit a roadmap item
- Save changes
- Check that `updated_at` timestamp changes
- Verify no "has no field 'updated_at'" errors

### 3. Console Monitoring
- Keep browser DevTools console open
- Watch for any database-related errors
- Confirm smooth operation

---

## Expected Results

### Before Migration
```
ERROR: record "new" has no field "updated_at"
```

### After Migration
- No errors during drag/drop
- Roadmap updates work smoothly
- `updated_at` timestamp updates automatically
- All roadmap functionality operational

---

## Rollback (if needed)

If issues occur, you can remove the column:

```sql
-- CAUTION: This will remove the updated_at column
ALTER TABLE public.project_roadmaps DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS updated_at;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_project_roadmaps_updated_at ON public.project_roadmaps;
```

However, this migration is designed to be safe and should not cause issues.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Migration SQL prepared
2. → **Execute SQL in Supabase SQL Editor** (CURRENT STEP)
3. → Run verification script
4. → Test roadmap drag/drop functionality
5. → Monitor application for errors
6. → Confirm smooth operation

---

## Summary

**Method Used**: Manual SQL execution via Supabase SQL Editor
**Migration File**: `migrations/add_updated_at_to_project_roadmaps.sql`
**SQL Editor URL**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vfovtgtjailvrphsgafv/sql
**Verification Command**: `node scripts/verify-migration.mjs`

**Status**: Ready for execution - SQL is prepared and clipboard-ready
**Estimated Time**: < 30 seconds to execute
**Risk Level**: Low (idempotent, has rollback option)

## Support Scripts Reference

All helper scripts are in the `scripts/` directory:

- `final-migration-attempt.mjs` - Opens editor and copies SQL
- `verify-migration.mjs` - Verifies migration success
- `apply-migration-direct.mjs` - Direct verification approach

Run any script with: `node scripts/<script-name>.mjs`
