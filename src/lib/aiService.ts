- For software projects: Focus on technical features, architecture, user experience, development, APIs, security  
- For business projects: Focus on operations, processes, efficiency, training, analytics, management
- For product projects: Focus on product features, user research, design, testing, roadmap, market fit

Requirements:
- Keep the title exactly as provided
- Make details a single string (not an object)
- Priority must be one of: low, moderate, high, strategic, innovation
- Be specific and actionable, avoid generic statements
- Ensure the idea fits the project context and type
