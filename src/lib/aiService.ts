- For software projects: Focus on technical features, architecture, user experience, development, APIs, security  
- For business projects: Focus on operations, processes, efficiency, training, analytics, management
- For product projects: Focus on product features, user research, design, testing, roadmap, market fit

Requirements:
- Keep the title exactly as provided
- Make details a single string (not an object)
- Priority must be one of: low, moderate, high, strategic, innovation
- Be specific and actionable, avoid generic statements
- Ensure the idea fits the project context and type

`Analyze the project description and recommend the MOST APPROPRIATE project type from:
- software (Software Development)
- product_development (Physical Product Development)  
- business_plan (Business Planning & Strategy)
- marketing (Marketing Campaign)
- operations (Operations Improvement)
- research (Research & Development)
- other (if none fit perfectly)

If recommending "other", provide detailed reasoning for custom user stories.`}

**TASK 2: IDEA GENERATION**
Generate 6-8 contextually relevant ideas based on the PROJECT TYPE:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- For marketing projects: Generate marketing-specific ideas (campaigns, content, SEO, social media, brand awareness, lead generation)
- For software projects: Generate tech-specific ideas (features, architecture, user experience, integrations, security, scalability)  
- For product_development: Generate product ideas (design, prototyping, testing, manufacturing, materials, user research)
- For business_plan: Generate strategy ideas (market research, financials, operations, partnerships, growth strategies)
- For operations: Generate process ideas (efficiency, automation, training, analytics, quality control)
- For research: Generate research ideas (methodology, data collection, analysis, validation, publication)
- For other: Generate domain-specific ideas based on the actual project description

DO NOT mix project types - each project should have domain-specific ideas only.

Your task is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the project ideas and create a strategic roadmap that demonstrates thorough business analysis thinking.
                
                PROJECT CONTEXT: ${this.getProjectContext(projectType, aiAnalysis)}
                
                BUSINESS ANALYST APPROACH - YOU MUST:
                1. **DEEP IDEA ANALYSIS**: Carefully analyze each provided idea to understand:
                   - The underlying business need/problem being solved
                   - Technical/operational complexity and dependencies
                   - Resource requirements and constraints
                   - Business value and strategic importance
                   - Risk factors and mitigation needs
                
                2. **STRATEGIC GROUPING**: Group related ideas into coherent ${this.getEpicTerminology(projectType)}s based on:
                   - Functional relationships and dependencies  
                   - Implementation complexity and sequencing
                   - Business value delivery cadence
                   - Resource allocation optimization
                   - Risk distribution and mitigation
                
                3. **CONTEXTUAL EPIC CREATION**: Each ${this.getEpicTerminology(projectType).toLowerCase()} must be:
                   - Highly specific to the project domain (${projectType || 'this industry'})
                   - Directly derived from the actual ideas provided
                   - Include specific technical/business requirements
                   - Address real implementation challenges
                   - Consider stakeholder needs and constraints
                
                4. **DETAILED USER STORIES**: Create ${this.getProjectTerminology(projectType)} that are:
                   - Specific to the project domain and context
                   - Based on actual stakeholder needs (not generic templates)
                   - Include acceptance criteria thinking
                   - Reference specific features/capabilities from the ideas
                
                5. **REALISTIC DELIVERABLES**: List concrete, measurable deliverables that:
                   - Map directly to the provided ideas
                   - Are specific to the ${projectType || 'project'} domain
                   - Include technical specifications, documentation, and validation criteria
                   - Consider compliance, testing, and quality requirements
                
                ANALYSIS DEPTH: Don't use generic templates. Analyze the specific ideas provided and create roadmap elements that demonstrate you understand the project's unique challenges, opportunities, and requirements.

- If it's about education ‚Üí use curriculum/learning terminology
- If it's about healthcare ‚Üí use medical/clinical terminology

For each epic you create:
1. **Use specific idea content** - Reference the exact ideas by their content (e.g., "${ideas[0]?.content || 'actual idea content'}")

3. **Write detailed descriptions** - Include technical specifics, domain expertise, and implementation details relevant to the actual ideas
4. **Group related ideas** - Combine complementary ideas into logical implementation groups

Example of what I want:
- Epic Title: "${ideas[0]?.content || 'Actual idea title'}" (not "Work Package 1.1")
- Description: Detailed analysis of this specific idea including technical approach, domain considerations, and implementation strategy
