# Real-Time Subscription Fix

## Issue Identified
The Supabase real-time subscriptions are failing with:
```
Error: mismatch between server and client bindings for postgres changes
```

## Root Cause
This error occurs when the Supabase client and server have mismatched schema definitions for real-time subscriptions. This prevents lock state changes from propagating between browsers.

## Immediate Fix Required

1. **Update Supabase real-time subscription configuration**
2. **Simplify the real-time filtering logic**
3. **Fix the channel binding mismatch**

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Simplify Real-Time Subscription
The current filtering logic is too complex and may be causing binding issues.

### 2. Update Supabase Configuration
Need to ensure the real-time bindings match the database schema.

### 3. Test Lock Propagation
After fixing the subscription, test that lock changes propagate properly.
