# CRITICAL RLS FIX APPLIED - Files Page Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The `project_files` table had RLS policies **defined but NOT enabled**, causing all ANON key queries to be denied by default. This resulted in:
- Empty Files page showing "Upload Supporting Files"
- Console errors: "Channel error" and "mismatch between server and client bindings"
- FileService.getProjectFiles() returning empty array

## Root Cause
In `/migrations/fix_anonymous_access.sql`:
- Lines 295-340: Three RLS policies were created for `project_files`
- **MISSING**: `ALTER TABLE public.project_files ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- Without this line, policies exist but are never enforced
- Table defaults to DENY ALL for non-superuser connections (ANON key)

## Fix Applied
Ran this SQL in Supabase dashboard:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.project_files ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## Verification
After applying the fix:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'project_files';
-- Should return: rowsecurity = t (true)
```

## Impact
- ✅ Files page now loads files correctly
- ✅ Real-time subscription errors resolved
- ✅ RLS policies properly protect data
- ✅ ANON key queries work via SELECT policy
