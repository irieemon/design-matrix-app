# AI Features E2E Test Suite Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive Playwright E2E test suite covering all AI feature user journeys with proper API mocking, loading states, error handling, and visual regression testing.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `ai-generation-journey.spec.ts` (35 tests)
**Coverage**: AI idea generation workflows
- Generate AI ideas with loading states
- AI idea quality and relevance validation
- Accept/reject AI suggestions
- Regenerate ideas functionality
- AI idea quadrant distribution
- Custom prompts for AI generation
- AI insights modal workflows
- Generate roadmap from AI ideas
- Rate limiting and error scenarios
- Performance tracking (progress, stages)
- Cost/token usage transparency

**API Mocking Strategy**:
```typescript
// Mock OpenAI endpoints
- /api/ai/generate-ideas → mockAIIdeas (8 diverse ideas)
- /api/ai/insights → mockAIInsights (executive summary, recommendations)
- /api/ai/generate-roadmap-v2 → mockRoadmap (phased delivery plan)
```

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- First-time AI idea generation user journey
- Iterative regeneration with different results
- Accepting/rejecting individual suggestions
- Bulk operations (accept all, clear all)
- Custom creativity/tolerance settings
- Integration with matrix quadrants
- Historical insights viewing
- PDF export functionality

### 2. `ai-file-analysis-journey.spec.ts` (30 tests)
**Coverage**: AI file analysis workflows
- Upload file for analysis (PDF, image, audio, video)
- File analysis loading states and progress
- View analysis results with insights
- Analysis caching (same file = cached result)
- Image analysis with GPT-4V
- Audio transcription with Whisper
- Text document analysis
- Multiple file analysis (batch processing)
- File analysis errors and retry mechanisms

**API Mocking Strategy**:
```typescript
// Mock file processing endpoints
- /api/upload → File upload with progress
- /api/ai/analyze-file → Multi-modal analysis routing
- /api/ai/analyze-image → GPT-4V image analysis
- /api/ai/transcribe-audio → Whisper transcription

// Mock analysis responses by file type
- Image: Visual description, OCR text extraction, insights
- Audio: Transcript, summary, key points
- PDF/Text: Document summary, requirements extraction
- Video: Frame analysis + audio transcript
```

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Upload document → analyze → view insights
- Batch upload multiple files → parallel analysis
- Image with text → OCR extraction → analysis
- Audio recording → transcribe → summarize
- Cached analysis for duplicate uploads
- File size/type validation
- Network error recovery
- Analysis relevance scoring

## Test Architecture

### Authentication Setup
```typescript
async function authenticateUser(page: Page) {
  // Auto-detects authentication state
  // Falls back to demo mode if needed
  // Ensures tests can run independently
}
```

### API Mocking Pattern
```typescript
async function mockAIAPIs(page: Page) {
  // Intercepts all AI API calls
  // Returns deterministic mock data
  // Simulates loading delays for realistic UX testing
  // Supports error scenarios (500, 429, network failures)
}
```

### Loading State Testing
- Progress bars and percentage tracking
- Stage indicators (analyzing → synthesizing → optimizing)
- Estimated time remaining
- Skeleton loaders and placeholders

### Error Handling Testing
- API failures (500, 503 errors)
- Rate limiting (429 with retry-after)
- Network timeouts and connection failures
- File validation errors (size, type)
- Graceful degradation with retry options

## Performance Benchmarks

### AI Idea Generation
- **Target**: < 3 seconds for 8 ideas
- **Loading State**: Visible within 500ms
- **Progress Updates**: Every 25% completion
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds with error message

### File Analysis
- **Image (GPT-4V)**: < 5 seconds
- **Audio (Whisper)**: < 10 seconds (depends on length)
- **PDF/Text**: < 3 seconds
- **Batch Analysis**: Parallel processing, < 15 seconds for 5 files
- **Caching**: < 500ms for cached results

## Visual Regression Testing

### Screenshots Captured
- AI generation modal states (empty, loading, results)
- File upload interface (idle, uploading, analyzing)
- Insights modal (loading, complete, error states)
- Roadmap visualization
- Rate limit warning messages
- Error states with retry options

### Responsive Testing
- Desktop (1440x900 primary viewport)
- Tablet (iPad dimensions)
- Mobile (iPhone 12 dimensions)

## User Journey Coverage

### Journey 1: First-Time AI User
1. Opens app → clicks "Generate AI Ideas"
2. Sees modal with project context form
3. Fills in project details + tolerance slider
4. Clicks "Generate" → sees loading animation
5. Reviews 8 AI-generated ideas
6. Accepts 5 ideas → distributed to quadrants
7. Regenerates for more options
8. Opens AI Insights to see strategic analysis

### Journey 2: File Analysis Power User
1. Uploads product requirements PDF
2. Waits for analysis (sees progress indicator)
3. Reviews extracted insights and relevance score
4. Uploads screenshot of competitor product
5. Sees visual analysis with OCR text extraction
6. Uploads audio from planning meeting
7. Reviews transcript and key discussion points
8. Generates AI insights informed by all uploaded files
9. Downloads comprehensive PDF report

### Journey 3: Rate Limit Experience
1. Generates AI ideas successfully (first request)
2. Tries to regenerate immediately
3. Hits rate limit → sees friendly message
4. Message explains: "Try again in 60 seconds" or "Sign in for higher limits"
5. Waits 60 seconds
6. Retry succeeds with new ideas

### Journey 4: Error Recovery
1. Attempts file upload with poor network
2. Upload fails → sees error with retry button
3. Clicks retry → successful upload
4. Analysis fails (API timeout)
5. Sees error message with "Analyze Again" button
6. Clicks retry → successful analysis
