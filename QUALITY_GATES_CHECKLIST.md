# Quality Gates & Manual Testing Checklist
## Design Matrix Card Visibility Validation

### Quality Gate Framework

This document establishes clear quality gates and manual testing procedures to ensure the design matrix cards meet high standards for visibility, accessibility, and user experience.

## Automated Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Critical Functionality ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING
- [ ] **All cards visible**: 100% of cards render within viewport bounds
- [ ] **Proper positioning**: Cards positioned according to matrix_position data
- [ ] **Z-index hierarchy**: Cards appear above background, below modals
- [ ] **No critical errors**: Zero JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] **Load performance**: Initial load completes within 3 seconds

**Failure Action**: Block deployment, immediate investigation required

### Gate 2: Performance Standards üìä BLOCKING
- [ ] **Render time**: < 100ms per card rendering
- [ ] **Memory usage**: < 50MB baseline with 20 cards
- [ ] **Console log rate**: < 5 logs per second after stabilization
- [ ] **Frame rate**: Maintain 30+ FPS during interactions
- [ ] **Network efficiency**: < 10 resources taking > 1 second to load

**Failure Action**: Performance investigation required before release

### Gate 3: Accessibility Compliance ‚ôø BLOCKING
- [ ] **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Zero critical accessibility violations
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- [ ] **Screen reader support**: Cards programmatically accessible
