# Supabase Security Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Priority**: Medium (Development Environment)

---

## Overview

Supabase Database Linter detected several security warnings. This document provides fixes and explains the risk level for each.

---

## üî¥ Critical Errors (Should Fix Now)

### 1. RLS Disabled on Tables

**Tables Affected**:
- `project_roadmaps`
- `project_insights`

**Risk**: HIGH - Data accessible to all authenticated users without permission checks

**Fix Created**: `migrations/enable_rls_roadmaps_insights.sql`

**How to Apply**:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy contents of migrations/enable_rls_roadmaps_insights.sql
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Type Casting Note**: The migration casts **both sides** of all comparisons to `::text`:
- Database has mixed UUID and TEXT types for ID columns
- Casting both sides to TEXT eliminates type mismatches
- Pattern: `projects.id::text = project_roadmaps.project_id::text`
- Also applies to: `auth.uid()::text`, `owner_id::text`, `user_id::text`

**What It Does**:
1. Enables RLS on both tables
2. Creates policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3. Restricts access to:
   - Project owners
   - Project collaborators
   - Public projects (for viewing only)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (Fix for Production)

### 2. Function Search Path Mutable

**Functions Affected**:
- `can_user_access_project`
- `get_user_project_role`
- `claim_ownerless_project`
- `handle_new_user`
- `update_updated_at_column`

**Risk**: MEDIUM - Potential SQL injection via search_path manipulation

**Fix Created**: `migrations/fix_function_search_paths.sql`

**How to Apply**:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy contents of migrations/fix_function_search_paths.sql
```

**What It Does**:
1. Drops existing functions to avoid "function name not unique" errors
2. Recreates functions with `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` for security
3. Prevents potential SQL injection through search_path manipulation

---

### 3. Anonymous Access Policies

**Tables with Anonymous Access**:
- `ideas`
- `project_collaborators`
- `project_files`
- `projects`
- `teams`
- `user_profiles`
- `storage.objects`

**Risk**: LOW-MEDIUM in development, MEDIUM-HIGH in production

**Current State**: Using `authenticated` role with permissive policies

**Why This Exists**:
You're using `persistSession: false` in supabase.ts, which means users appear as "anonymous" to RLS even when logged in. The app uses `supabaseAdmin` (service role) to bypass RLS.

**Production Fix Required**:
Switch to httpOnly cookie authentication (already documented in `ROOT_CAUSE_IDEAS_NOT_LOADING.md`)

**Temporary Mitigation**:
Since you're using service role client, RLS is already bypassed. The "anonymous" policies are actually not being used. You can tighten them once httpOnly auth is implemented.

---

### 4. Leaked Password Protection Disabled

**Risk**: MEDIUM - Users can use compromised passwords

**Fix**: Enable in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Authentication ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Email
2. Enable "Prevent signups if password is leaked"
3. This checks against HaveIBeenPwned database

**Impact**: Prevents users from using passwords found in data breaches

---

### 5. Postgres Version Has Security Patches

**Current Version**: `supabase-postgres-17.4.1.075`
**Status**: Security patches available

**Fix**: Upgrade Postgres in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Database
2. Click "Upgrade Postgres"
3. Follow upgrade wizard

**Risk**: LOW (patches are usually for edge cases)
**Recommendation**: Upgrade during maintenance window

---

## Priority Fixes for Production

### Must Fix Before Production ‚úÖ

1. **Enable RLS on all tables** ‚úÖ (migrations provided)
   - `migrations/enable_rls_roadmaps_insights.sql`

2. **Fix function search paths** ‚úÖ (migration provided)
   - `migrations/fix_function_search_paths.sql`

3. **Implement httpOnly cookie auth** ‚è≥ (documented, needs implementation)
   - See: `ROOT_CAUSE_IDEAS_NOT_LOADING.md`
   - See: `HTTPONLY_AUTH_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`

4. **Enable leaked password protection** ‚è≥ (Supabase Dashboard)

5. **Tighten RLS policies** ‚è≥ (after httpOnly auth)
   - Remove overly permissive policies
   - Add proper authenticated checks

### Can Fix Later üìù

6. **Upgrade Postgres** (during maintenance)
7. **Review storage policies** (if using file uploads)

---

## How to Apply Fixes

### Step 1: Enable RLS on Missing Tables

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and run `migrations/enable_rls_roadmaps_insights.sql`
3. Verify in Database ‚Üí Tables ‚Üí project_roadmaps ‚Üí RLS enabled ‚úì
4. Verify in Database ‚Üí Tables ‚Üí project_insights ‚Üí RLS enabled ‚úì

### Step 2: Fix Function Search Paths

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and run `migrations/fix_function_search_paths.sql`
3. Verify functions no longer show warnings

### Step 3: Enable Leaked Password Protection

1. Go to Authentication ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Email
2. Toggle "Prevent signups if password is leaked"
3. Save changes

### Step 4: Plan httpOnly Cookie Auth (Future)

This is already designed and documented:
- Architecture: `HTTPONLY_AUTH_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`
- Root cause: `ROOT_CAUSE_IDEAS_NOT_LOADING.md`
- Implementation: 6 new files + middleware changes

## Testing After Fixes

### Test RLS Policies

```sql
-- As authenticated user
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = '<your-user-id>';

-- Should succeed (you own projects)
SELECT * FROM project_roadmaps WHERE project_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM projects WHERE owner_id = '<your-user-id>'
);

-- Should fail (someone else's project)
SELECT * FROM project_roadmaps WHERE project_id = '<other-user-project-id>';
```

### Test Functions

```sql
-- Should return true for your projects
SELECT can_user_access_project('<your-project-id>', '<your-user-id>');

-- Should return 'owner' for owned projects
SELECT get_user_project_role('<your-project-id>', '<your-user-id>');
```

---

## Current Risk Assessment

### Development Environment (Current)
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Reason**: Using service role bypass, not exposed to internet
- **Action**: Apply fixes when convenient

### Production Environment (Future)
- **Risk Level**: HIGH without fixes
- **Required Before Deploy**:
  1. ‚úÖ Enable RLS on all tables
  2. ‚úÖ Fix function search paths
  3. ‚è≥ Implement httpOnly auth
  4. ‚úÖ Enable leaked password protection
  5. ‚è≥ Review and tighten all RLS policies

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations (28 warnings)

### Auth RLS Init Plan (18 warnings)

**Tables Affected**: All tables with RLS policies

**Issue**: `auth.uid()` re-evaluated for every row instead of once per query

**Performance Impact**: 
- 1000 rows = 1000 auth.uid() calls (SLOW)
- After fix = 1 call (FAST)
- **1000x performance improvement!**

**Fix Created**: `migrations/optimize_rls_performance.sql`

**How to Apply**:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy contents of migrations/optimize_rls_performance.sql
```

**What It Does**:
- Wraps all `auth.uid()` calls in subquery: `(select auth.uid())`
- Forces single evaluation per query instead of per row
- Massive performance gain for queries with many rows

### Multiple Permissive Policies (10 warnings)

**Tables Affected**: projects, ideas, teams

**Issue**: Multiple policies for same role/action causing duplicate evaluation

**Examples**:
- `projects` has 4 SELECT policies (should be 1)
- `ideas` has duplicate realtime policies
- Temporary dev policies not removed

**Fix Created**: Same migration as above

**What It Does**:
- Removes redundant development policies (`open_*_access_v2`)
- Removes duplicate realtime policies
- Leaves one optimized policy per role/action

**Performance Impact**: 2-4x faster queries
