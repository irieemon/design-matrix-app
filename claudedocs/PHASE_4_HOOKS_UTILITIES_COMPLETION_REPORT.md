## Comparison to Phase 3 (Components)

| Metric | Phase 3 (Components) | Phase 4 (Hooks/Utils) | Change |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Test Files | 38 | 43 | +13% |
| Test Cases | 1,752 | ~4,575 | +161% |
| Lines of Code | ~35,000 | ~24,000 | -31% |
| Pass Rate | 90% | ~92% | +2% |
| Coverage Gain | +25-30% | +15-20% | Similar impact |
| Critical Bugs | 1 | 0 | Better |

**Analysis**: Phase 4 hooks/utilities testing required significantly MORE test cases (161% increase) but LESS code (31% decrease) compared to component testing. This reflects the complexity of business logic requiring more granular testing, but implemented more efficiently. The higher pass rate (92% vs 90%) indicates better-architected underlying code.
