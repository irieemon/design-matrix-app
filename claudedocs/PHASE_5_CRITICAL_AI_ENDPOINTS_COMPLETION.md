  - Unauthenticated users: 2 requests/minute
- ✅ Request Validation (3 tests) - ALL PASSING
- ⚠️ Audio File Download (2 tests) - 0% passing
  - Mock fetch call assertions need adjustment

#### Issues to Fix:
Most failures are due to mock setup issues with the fetch API calls. The handler is likely returning errors before the fetch mocks are reached. Need to:
1. Ensure proper async/await handling in mocks
2. Verify mock return values match expected structure
3. Add better error logging to identify where tests fail

## Business Logic Tested

### File Analysis (analyze-file.ts)
1. **Multi-Format Routing**
   - Image files → GPT-4V analysis
   - Audio/Video files → Whisper transcription
   - Text/PDF files → GPT-4 text analysis
   - Unknown formats → Graceful degradation

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Check if analysis_status === 'completed'
   - Return cached ai_analysis if available
   - Skip expensive API calls for cached data

3. **Status Management**
   - pending → analyzing → completed/failed/skipped
   - Database updates at each stage
   - Error status updates on failure

### Image Analysis (analyze-image.ts)
1. **Analysis Type Routing**
   - general: Comprehensive overview
   - ui_design: UX/UI focus
   - data_visualization: Chart/graph analysis
   - process_diagram: Workflow/flowchart analysis
   - document_screenshot: Text extraction focus

2. **Response Processing**
   - JSON parsing for structured responses
   - Text fallback for unstructured responses
   - Text extraction from quoted content
   - Insight extraction from bullet points

3. **Relevance Assessment**
   - High: Project name/type mentioned
   - Medium: Generic business keywords
   - Low: No connection indicators

### Audio Transcription (transcribe-audio.ts)
1. **Transcription Pipeline**
   - Download audio from URL
   - Convert to Blob for Whisper API
   - Transcribe with verbose JSON format
   - Generate summary with GPT-4

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Confidence calculation from log probabilities
   - Speaker detection from pause patterns
   - Key point extraction from keywords
   - Summary generation for long transcripts

3. **Project Integration**
   - Project context in Whisper prompt
   - Relevance scoring based on project mentions
   - Key point filtering by project keywords

## Comparison to Estimates

| Metric | Estimated | Actual | Variance |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Test Files | 3 | 3 | 0% |
| Test Cases | 210 | 209 | -0.5% |
| Lines of Code | 2,000 | 1,900 | -5% |
| Pass Rate | 85% | 93.8% | +10.4% |
| Time to Complete | 3 days | 2 hours | -91% |
