# Testing Session Persistence Fix

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**Commit**: `b5496ad` - Fix session persistence on page refresh
**Status**: ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub
**Deployed**: ⏳ Waiting for Vercel deployment

---

## 🖥️ Local Testing (Development Environment)

### ⚠️ Important: Clear Browser Cache First

The fix changes `src/lib/supabase.ts`, which is bundled into your JavaScript. **Your browser has cached the old version**, which is why you're still seeing the issue locally.

### Step 1: Stop and Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C or Command+C)

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: **Hard Refresh** Your Browser

**Chrome/Edge** (Windows/Linux):
- `Ctrl + Shift + R` OR
- `Ctrl + F5`

**Chrome/Edge** (Mac):
- `Command + Shift + R`

**Firefox**:
- `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
- `Command + Shift + R` (Mac)

**Safari**:
- `Command + Option + R`

### Step 3: Clear Specific Site Data (Nuclear Option)

If hard refresh doesn't work:

1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Storage** in left sidebar
4. Click **Clear site data** button
5. Refresh page

### Step 4: Test Locally

1. Login to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Navigate to a project: `/?project=deade958-e26c-4c4b-99d6-8476c326427b`
3. **Press F5 to refresh**
4. **Expected**: Project loads, you stay authenticated ✅
5. **Check Console**: Should see `"🔐 Session check result: session found"`

## 🚀 Production Testing (prioritas.ai)

### Step 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find project: `design-matrix-app`
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. **Wait for**: Commit `b5496ad` to show "Ready" (3-5 minutes)
5. **Verify commit**: Click deployment → Check commit message matches "Fix session persistence"

### Step 2: Clear Production Site Data

**Before testing**, clear cached data for `prioritas.ai`:

1. Visit: https://prioritas.ai
2. **Open DevTools** (F12)
3. Go to **Application** tab
4. Left sidebar → **Storage**
5. Click **Clear site data** button
6. **Close and reopen** browser tab

### Step 3: Test on Production

1. Login to: https://prioritas.ai
2. Navigate to: `/?project=deade958-e26c-4c4b-99d6-8476c326427b`
3. **Press F5 to refresh**
4. **Expected**: ✅ Project loads, you stay authenticated
5. **NOT Expected**: ❌ Redirect to login screen

### Step 4: Verify in Console

Open DevTools Console and check for:

**✅ Success Indicators**:
```
🔐 Session check result: session found
✅ User already signed in: your@email.com
```

**❌ Failure Indicators**:
```
⏰ Session check timeout after 5000ms
⚠️ Auth timeout reached after 8000ms
❌ No active session found
```

## 🔍 Diagnosing Issues

### Issue: "Still getting logged out on refresh"

**Check 1: Is the new code deployed?**
- Console → Look for the new session check logs
- If you see old log patterns → Cache not cleared

**Check 2: Are cookies being set?**
- DevTools → Application → Cookies → `prioritas.ai`
- Should see: `sb-access-token`, `sb-refresh-token`
- Both should be `HttpOnly: true`, `Secure: true`

**Check 3: What does session check return?**
- Console → Filter by "Session check result"
- If `session: undefined` → Cookies not being read
- If `session: found` but still logout → Different issue

### Issue: "Session check timeout" in console

This means `supabase.auth.getSession()` is taking > 5 seconds.

**Possible causes**:
1. **Slow network** → Session validation requires network call
2. **Old Supabase version** → Try updating `@supabase/supabase-js`
3. **Browser extension interfering** → Test in Incognito mode

**Temporary workaround** (if needed):
- Increase timeout in `src/hooks/useAuth.ts:644`
- Change `sessionTimeoutMs = 5000` to `10000`

### Issue: "Auth timeout reached after 8000ms"

This is the overall auth initialization timeout.

**If session check succeeds but this still appears**:
- Profile fetch is too slow (`/api/auth?action=user`)
- Network issue between frontend and backend
- Check Network tab → Filter by `auth` → Look for slow requests

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix (Broken)
```
User refreshes page
  ↓
supabase.auth.getSession() called
  ↓
persistSession: false → SKIP session check
  ↓
No session found
  ↓
Redirect to login ❌
```

### After Fix (Working)
```
User refreshes page
  ↓
supabase.auth.getSession() called
  ↓
persistSession: true → CHECK for session
  ↓
Read httpOnly cookies (sb-access-token)
  ↓
Validate token with Supabase
  ↓
Session found ✅
  ↓
User authenticated, project loads
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Commands

### Check Current Commit (Local)
```bash
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: b5496ad Fix session persistence on page refresh
```

### Verify Supabase Config (Local)
```bash
grep -A 10 "persistSession" src/lib/supabase.ts
# Should show: persistSession: true
```

### Check Dev Server Is Running Latest Code
```bash
# Kill all node processes
pkill -f "vite"

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Check Vercel Deployment Status
```bash
# If you have Vercel CLI installed
vercel list

# Or check manually: https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

The fix is working when ALL of these are true:

1. ✅ **Page refresh maintains authentication**
   - Refresh `/?project=xxx` → Stay logged in

2. ✅ **Console shows session found**
   - `🔐 Session check result: session found`

3. ✅ **No timeout warnings**
   - No `Session check timeout` messages

4. ✅ **Project loads from URL**
   - Project parameter is respected

5. ✅ **Cookies persist**
   - DevTools shows `sb-access-token` and `sb-refresh-token`

---

## 🚨 If Still Not Working After All Steps

1. **Take screenshots of**:
   - Console tab (all messages)
   - Application → Cookies (show all cookies)
   - Network tab → Filter by `auth` (show requests)

2. **Provide information**:
   - Testing environment (local or production)
   - Vercel deployment commit (from dashboard)
   - Browser and version

3. **I'll investigate**:
   - Session validation timing
   - Cookie configuration
   - Potential race conditions

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Local Testing First** (optional)
   - Clear cache and hard refresh
   - Test on `localhost:5173`

2. **Production Testing** (required)
   - Wait for Vercel deployment of `b5496ad`
   - Clear production site data
   - Test on `prioritas.ai`

3. **Report Back**
   - Does it work on production?
   - Any console errors?
   - Screenshots if issues persist

---

**Remember**: The fix is in the JavaScript bundle, so **cache clearing is critical** for testing!
