|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Original** | Medium | 2-3 weeks |
| **Lux** | Medium | 2-3 weeks |
| **Lux Animated** | High | 3-4 weeks |

**Why Animated Takes Longer:**
- Need to add motion utilities
- Test reduced motion
- Fine-tune timings
- Performance audit
- More QA required

## Mix & Match Options

You can also combine elements:

**Popular Combinations:**

1. **Lux Foundations + Original Buttons**
   - Off-white canvas (easier on eyes)
   - Hairline borders (refined)
   - Black buttons (stronger CTAs)
   - Best of both worlds

2. **Original Design + Lux Animations**
   - Bold visual hierarchy
   - Refined micro-interactions
   - Premium yet clear

3. **Lux + Selective Animation**
   - Calm base design
   - Animated buttons only
   - Less complex than full animated
