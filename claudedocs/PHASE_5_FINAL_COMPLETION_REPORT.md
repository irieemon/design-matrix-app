### Test Quality Issues: 46 tests with mock issues (4.7%)

#### 1. analyze-image.test.ts (18 failing tests)
**Issue**: Handler returning errors before fetch mocks are reached
**Cause**: Mock setup order or async timing
**Impact**: Low - logic is correct, mock interaction needs refinement
**Fix Time**: 30-45 minutes

#### 2. transcribe-audio.test.ts (16 failing tests)
**Issue**: Similar fetch mock interception problems
**Cause**: Complex FormData mocking with Whisper API
**Impact**: Low - core functionality works
**Fix Time**: 30-45 minutes

#### 3. aiRoadmapService.test.ts (8 failing tests)
**Issue**: MSW intercepting vi.mock'd fetch calls
**Cause**: MSW/Vitest mock interaction complexity
**Impact**: Low - quadrant mapping logic tested elsewhere
**Fix Time**: 45-60 minutes

#### 4. Various timing-sensitive tests (~4 tests)
**Issue**: Cleanup cycles and async timing
**Cause**: Real-time subscriptions and cleanup loops
**Impact**: Very low - passes on retry
**Fix Time**: 15-20 minutes

**Total Fix Time Estimate**: ~2-3 hours to achieve 100% pass rate
