# Checkpoint System for Animated Lux Migration

## Purpose

This directory contains checkpoint files for the Animated Lux design system migration. Each checkpoint represents a major milestone and can be used to resume work or rollback if needed.

## Checkpoint Format

Each checkpoint is a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
phase: 1
phase_name: "Foundation Layer"
status: completed | in_progress | pending
started: 2025-10-02T15:00:00Z
completed: 2025-10-02T16:30:00Z
git_branch: feature/lux-phase-1-foundation
git_commit: abc123def456

completed_tasks:
  - Task description 1
  - Task description 2

current_task: "Task currently in progress"

next_steps:
  - Next task 1
  - Next task 2

files_created:
  - path/to/file1.css
  - path/to/file2.js

files_modified:
  - path/to/modified1.tsx
  - path/to/modified2.ts

issues_encountered:
  - description: "Issue description"
    resolution: "How it was resolved"

validation_results:
  tests_passing: true
  visual_regression: "<5%"
  build_status: "success"
  accessibility: "WCAG AA compliant"

## How to Use

### Creating a Checkpoint
```bash
# After completing a major milestone
# Create the YAML file with current state
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Checkpoint: Phase X - Description"
git tag -a "lux-checkpoint-phase-X" -m "Checkpoint: Phase X"
```

### Resuming from a Checkpoint
```bash
# Read the checkpoint file
cat claudedocs/checkpoints/phase-X-name.yaml

# Check out the git commit
git checkout <git_commit_from_yaml>

# Or use the tag
git checkout lux-checkpoint-phase-X
```

### Rolling Back to a Checkpoint
```bash
# Reset to checkpoint
git reset --hard lux-checkpoint-phase-X

# Or revert changes
git revert <commit_range>
```

## Session Notes

Session notes are stored in `claudedocs/sessions/` with the format:
`session-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

Each session note contains:
- Phase being worked on
- Duration
- Tasks completed
- Issues encountered
- Next session priorities
