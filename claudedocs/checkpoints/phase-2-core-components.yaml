git_branch: feature/lux-phase-2-core-components
git_commit: pending

completed_tasks:
  - Applied Animated Lux styling to Button component (all variants)
  - Applied Animated Lux styling to Input component (all variants)

current_task: "Need to apply Lux to Card components (excluding idea cards)"

next_steps:
  - Identify all Card components (exclude IdeaCardComponent, OptimizedIdeaCard)
  - Apply Lux card-hover animation (shadow expansion, +2% tint)
  - Test visual changes in development
  - Complete Phase 2 checkpoint

files_modified:
  - src/styles/button.css (Lux styling for all button variants)
  - src/styles/input.css (Lux styling for all input variants)
  - src/styles/textarea.css (base Lux transitions)
  - src/styles/select.css (base Lux transitions)

button_changes:
  - Primary: graphite-700 bg, -1px hover lift, Lux shadows
  - Secondary: hairline borders, canvas backgrounds, Lux focus ring
  - Tertiary: graphite text, canvas hover, smooth transitions
  - Danger: garnet-700 hover, Lux shadows
  - Ghost: graphite colors, canvas hover
  - All: 140ms fast easing, 120ms instant press, Lux focus rings

input_changes:
  - Borders: hairline-default â†’ hairline-hover â†’ hairline-focus (sapphire)
  - Focus ring: Lux sapphire ring (190ms glide easing)
  - Icons: graphite-500 â†’ sapphire-500 on focus (140ms transition)
  - Backgrounds: surface-primary (white) or canvas-secondary (off-white)
  - Placeholders: graphite-400
  - All variants updated (primary, secondary, tertiary)

validation_results:
  build_status: "success"
  build_time: "5.80s"
  css_bundle_size: "296.18 kB (36.72 kB gzipped)" # +1.74 kB from Phase 1
  bundle_increase: "+1.74 kB (0.6% increase - acceptable)"
  warnings: "Pre-existing (@keyframes none, chunk sizes)"
  errors: 0
  visual_changes: "YES - Buttons and inputs now use Lux colors/animations"

visual_changes_expected:
  buttons:
    - Primary buttons now graphite (not pure black)
    - All buttons have -1px hover lift
    - Sapphire focus rings instead of black outlines
    - Wider, softer shadows

  inputs:
    - Hairline borders (lighter, more refined)
    - Sapphire focus rings with smooth fade-in
    - Icons change color on focus
    - Smoother transitions (190ms glide)

issues_encountered: []

notes: |
  Phase 2 is progressing well! Buttons and Inputs now fully use Animated Lux.

  Visual changes are now visible:
  - Buttons have the refined graphite color (#374151) instead of pure black
  - All interactive elements have smooth Lux animations
  - Focus rings are sapphire with soft glow
  - Shadows are width-dominant and subtle

  Still need to:
  - Apply card-hover to Card components (excluding idea cards)
  - Full testing of visual changes
  - Visual regression baseline capture

  Risk Level: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM - High usage components, visual changes active
  Rollback: git reset --hard lux-checkpoint-phase-1
