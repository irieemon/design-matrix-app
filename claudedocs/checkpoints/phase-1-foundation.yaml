notes: |
  Phase 1 Foundation Layer complete successfully!

  All Animated Lux design tokens are now available throughout the application:
  - CSS custom properties: var(--graphite-500), var(--duration-fast), etc.
  - Tailwind classes: bg-graphite-700, shadow-button-lux, duration-140, etc.
  - Animation utilities: btn-hover-lift, card-hover, input-focus, etc.

  NO VISUAL CHANGES YET - Tokens are available but not applied to components.

  Build is successful with no new errors or warnings. The existing warnings
  (@keyframes none, chunk sizes) were present before this phase.

  Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Core Components
  - Next: Apply Lux styling to Buttons, Inputs, Cards
  - Expected: Visual changes will begin appearing

  Risk Level: âœ… LOW - Foundation only, no functionality changes
  Rollback: git reset --hard lux-checkpoint-phase-1
