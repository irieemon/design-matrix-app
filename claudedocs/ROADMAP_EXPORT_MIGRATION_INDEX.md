## Statement Distribution

### By Method
| Method | Statements | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| captureElement | 3 | ✅ Already migrated |
| createPDF | 1 | ❌ Needs migration |
| exportMultiPagePDF | 8 | ❌ Needs migration |
| exportRoadmapElement | 8 | ❌ Needs migration |

| Level | Count | Percentage | Production Visible |
|-------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| DEBUG | 10 | 62.5% | ❌ No (filtered) |
| INFO | 4 | 25.0% | ✅ Yes |
| ERROR | 2 | 12.5% | ✅ Yes |

### By Category

---

## Risk Summary

### Overall Risk: LOW ✅

**Why low risk:**
- File already partially migrated (pattern proven)
- Static class (no React/hook complexity)
- Logging is side-effect only
- 62.5% of logs are DEBUG (auto-filtered in prod)
- Build verified passing
- Zero breaking changes expected

**Potential issues:**
- Build failure: 5% probability
- Export breaks: 5% probability
- Too verbose: 10% probability (mitigated by debug filtering)
- Missing context: 10% probability (mitigated by rich metadata)

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-verify build ✅
- Test all export modes after migration
- Verify debug filtering works
- Use provided metadata structures

---

## Pattern Summary

### Current Pattern (Already Working)
```typescript
import { logger } from '../lib/logging'
private static exportLogger = logger.withContext({ component: 'RoadmapExporter' })
this.exportLogger.debug('Capturing element', { visibility, display, opacity })
```

### Migration Pattern
```typescript
// User action
console.log('Starting export:', options)
→ this.exportLogger.info('Starting export', { exportMode, format, title })

// Internal progress
console.log('Processing page 1/3')
→ this.exportLogger.debug('Processing page', { pageIndex: 0, totalPages: 3 })

// Error with alert
console.error('Export failed:', error)
→ this.exportLogger.error('Export failed', error, { exportMode, operation })
```

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Pass ✅
- Build passes: `npm run build`
- Zero console statements: `grep -c "console\." src/utils/roadmapExport.ts` → 0
- All exports work: PDF, PNG, overview, detailed, track
- Errors preserved: User alerts still shown

### Should Achieve ✅
- 22 exportLogger calls (up from 6)
- Rich metadata on all logs
- Appropriate log levels (debug/info/error)
- Production filtering verified (debug hidden)

---

## Key Insights from Analysis

### 1. Actual Count Lower Than Estimated
**Expected:** 25 statements
**Actual:** 16 statements
**Reduction:** 36% less work than estimated
**Reason:** File already partially migrated (27% done)

### 2. Zero Architectural Changes Needed
**Pattern already exists and works:**
- exportLogger already created
- logger.withContext() already imported
- 6 statements already migrated successfully
**Conclusion:** Simple find-and-replace migration, no refactoring

### 3. Appropriate Log Level Distribution
**DEBUG:** 62.5% (internal debugging, filtered in production)
**INFO:** 25% (user-facing actions/outcomes)
**ERROR:** 12.5% (failures with user alerts)
**Conclusion:** Well-suited for export utility operations
