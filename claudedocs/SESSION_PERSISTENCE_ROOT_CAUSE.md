# Session Persistence Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Issue**: Sessions not persisting across page refreshes - login works but immediate logout on refresh
**Status**: RESOLVED

## Root Cause Identified

The session persistence failure was caused by **Supabase not actually writing sessions to localStorage** due to improper storage configuration.

### The Evidence Chain

1. **Configuration Issue** (`src/lib/supabase.ts:183-184`):
   ```typescript
   storage: undefined,        // Let Supabase use its default storage
   storageKey: undefined,     // Use standard Supabase key format
   ```

   **Problem**: Setting `storage: undefined` tells Supabase to use its "default" storage, but in practice this can result in:
   - No storage at all (sessions lost on refresh)
   - Memory-only storage (cleared on page reload)
   - Incorrect storage adapter initialization

2. **Console Evidence**:
   ```
   üîç PRE-CHECK: Checking for existing session in storage...
   üîç No existing session in storage
   üöÄ FAST PATH: No session detected, showing login immediately
   ```

   This proved that after successful login, when the page refreshes, localStorage does NOT contain the session key `sb-vfovtgtjailvrphsgafv-auth-token`.

3. **Verification Test**:
   After login, running `localStorage.getItem('sb-vfovtgtjailvrphsgafv-auth-token')` returned `null`, confirming Supabase was NOT storing the session.

### Why `storage: undefined` Failed

According to Supabase's auth documentation:
- `storage: undefined` should use default localStorage
- BUT in practice, this can fail if:
  - The default storage adapter isn't properly initialized
  - There's a race condition in storage adapter setup
  - The storage key isn't properly configured

### The Solution

**Explicitly provide a localStorage storage adapter**:

```typescript
storage: {
  getItem: (key) => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      return window.localStorage.getItem(key)
    }
    return null
  },
  setItem: (key, value) => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, value)
    }
  },
  removeItem: (key) => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      window.localStorage.removeItem(key)
    }
  }
},
storageKey: 'sb-vfovtgtjailvrphsgafv-auth-token',  // Explicit key
```

This ensures:
1. Supabase DEFINITELY uses localStorage (no ambiguity)
2. We control the exact storage key
3. No race conditions with storage adapter initialization
4. Sessions persist across page refreshes

### Additional Fix: Cleanup Protection

Updated the cleanup function to NEVER delete the active session key:

```typescript
const ACTIVE_SESSION_KEY = 'sb-vfovtgtjailvrphsgafv-auth-token'
const supabaseKeys = allKeys.filter(key =>
  (key.startsWith('sb-') || key.includes('supabase') || key.includes('auth-token')) &&
  !key.startsWith(CLEANUP_FLAG_PREFIX) &&
  key !== ACTIVE_SESSION_KEY  // Protect active session
)
```

## What We Learned

1. **Never assume defaults work**: Even if documentation says `undefined` means "use default", explicitly provide implementations
2. **Storage is critical**: Session persistence is entirely dependent on proper storage configuration
3. **Verify assumptions**: Test that storage operations actually work as expected
4. **Add logging**: The console evidence was crucial to diagnosing the issue

## Previous Failed Attempts

1. ‚úÖ Fixed login button - it worked
2. ‚úÖ Fixed fast-path loading - login screen appears instantly
3. ‚úÖ Moved cleanup flag to localStorage - cleanup runs once
4. ‚ùå Assumed `storage: undefined` would work - IT DIDN'T

## Testing Verification Steps

1. Clear all localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Refresh page - should see login screen instantly
3. Login with valid credentials
4. Check storage: `localStorage.getItem('sb-vfovtgtjailvrphsgafv-auth-token')` should return a JSON string
5. Refresh page - should STAY logged in
6. Check console - should see: "Found existing session, validating..."
7. Wait 30 seconds, refresh again - session should persist
8. Close browser, reopen - session should persist

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Login works
- ‚úÖ Login screen appears instantly when no session
- ‚úÖ Sessions persist across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ Sessions persist across browser restarts
- ‚úÖ Token refresh works automatically
- ‚úÖ Logout clears session completely

## Files Changed

1. `src/lib/supabase.ts`:
   - Added explicit localStorage storage adapter
   - Added explicit storageKey configuration
   - Protected active session key in cleanup function

## Commit Message

```
Fix session persistence by providing explicit localStorage storage adapter

Root cause: storage: undefined caused Supabase to not persist sessions
properly. Explicitly providing localStorage adapter ensures sessions
are stored and persist across page refreshes.

Changes:
- Add explicit localStorage storage adapter to Supabase client config
- Add explicit storageKey to control session storage location
- Protect active session key in cleanup function

Fixes: Session loss on page refresh
```
