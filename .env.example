# Supabase Configuration
# Get these values from your Supabase project dashboard

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# IMPORTANT: AI API keys are now SERVER-SIDE ONLY for security
# These should be set in your deployment environment (Vercel, etc.)
# DO NOT add VITE_ prefix as these should NOT be exposed to clients

# OpenAI API Configuration (Server-side only - for AI features)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key

# Anthropic API Configuration (Server-side only - alternative to OpenAI)  
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (remove .example)
# 2. Replace the Supabase placeholder values with your actual keys
# 3. For AI features, set the API keys in your deployment environment:
#    - In Vercel: Project Settings > Environment Variables
#    - Add: OPENAI_API_KEY and/or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (without VITE_ prefix)
# 4. The .env file is already in .gitignore and won't be committed
#
