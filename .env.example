# Server-side Supabase Configuration (required for API endpoints)
# This key has elevated permissions and should NEVER be exposed to clients
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# IMPORTANT: AI API keys are now SERVER-SIDE ONLY for security
# These should be set in your deployment environment (Vercel, etc.)
# DO NOT add VITE_ prefix as these should NOT be exposed to clients

# OpenAI API Configuration (Server-side only - for AI features)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key

# Anthropic API Configuration (Server-side only - alternative to OpenAI)  
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (remove .example)
# 2. Replace the Supabase placeholder values with your actual keys
# 3. For AI features, set the API keys in your deployment environment:
#    - In Vercel: Project Settings > Environment Variables
#    - Add: OPENAI_API_KEY and/or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (without VITE_ prefix)
# 4. The .env file is already in .gitignore and won't be committed
# 
# To get Supabase keys:

# Rate Limiting Configuration
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Environment mode (affects rate limiting strictness)
# development: 10-20x more lenient limits for rapid iteration
# production: Strict limits for security (brute-force protection)
# Defaults to 'production' if not set
NODE_ENV=development

# DEVELOPMENT ONLY: Bypass rate limiting entirely
# ⚠️  DANGER: Completely disables brute-force protection
# ⚠️  NEVER set to 'true' in production
# Set to 'true' only for local testing when rate limits are blocking development
# Default: false (rate limiting enabled)
